# Signal Quantization and Huffman Encoding Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of **signal quantization** and **Huffman encoding** for digital communication systems. It includes:
- Sampling and quantization of a continuous-time signal.
- Analysis of quantization error and Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR).
- Huffman encoding for efficient data compression.

---

## Implementation Details

### Signal Generation
A sinusoidal signal \( x(t) = a \cdot \sin(0.5 \cdot b \cdot \pi \cdot t) \) is generated with:
- \( a = 2 \), \( b = 9 \), sampling rate \( f_s = 2 \).

### Quantization
The signal is quantized using uniform quantization with levels \( L = 2, 4, 8 \):
- Quantization error, variance, and SQNR are calculated for each level.
- Key metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Quantization Error.
  - Variance of Quantization Error (practical and theoretical).
  - SQNR (practical and theoretical).

### Huffman Encoding
The quantized signal is encoded using Huffman coding:
- Compression efficiency and compression rate are computed.
- Compression Efficiency: Percentage of data size reduction.
- Compression Rate: Ratio of original to encoded data size.

---

## Results
The project produces the following plots:
1. **Input Signal vs Quantized Signal**: Visualizes the original and quantized signals.
2. **Mean Absolute Quantization Error vs L**: Shows how quantization error varies with the number of levels.
3. **Variance of Quantization Error vs L**: Compares practical and theoretical variance.
4. **SQNR vs L**: Compares practical and theoretical SQNR.

Additionally, the Huffman encoding results include:
- **Compression Efficiency**: Percentage of data size reduction.
- **Compression Rate**: Ratio of original to encoded data size.
